* ISO 9000-3 Part 3: Guidelines for the application of ISO 9001:1994 to the development, supply, installation and maintenance of computer software states these additional processes very clearly, but is not mandatory. (This is now ISO 90003.)

* "The evidence was in the FDA's "recall" database. The medical equipment industry recalls about 400 products a year. Not all recalls involve life-threatening problems, but each implies that the product has serious problems inherent in its design. Twice as many computer-related recalls occurred in 1984 as in 1982 or any prior year. Most computer-related recalls were caused by software errors [29]. There were 84 software-related recalls from 1983 through 1987. Recalls continue to occur [30]. Recalled devices included ultrasound units, patient monitors, blood analyzers, pacemakers, ventilators, and infusion pumps. A blood analyzer displayed incorrect values because addition, rather than subtraction, had been programmed into a calibration formula. A multiple-patient monitoring system mixed up patients' names with the wrong data. An infusion pump would continually infuse insulin if the operator entered "0" as the maximum value to be infused. Another pump would ignore settings of less than 1.0 milliliter per hour and deliver instead whatever the previous setting was, up to 700 milliliters per hour. If a certain command sequence was entered into one pacemaker programmer, the pacemaker would enter a random unpredictable state. In one ventilator, the patient disconnect alarm could fail to sound when needed, and the gas concentrations (like oxygen) could decrease without activation of an alarm or indication on the display. In many of these applications, as in the Therac incidents, failure of the control system could cause people to be killed."

* Therefore, within the medical device industry a decision was made to recognize ISO/IEC 12207 (1995) (a general software engineering life cycle process standard) as being suitable for general medical device software development."
* However, the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) software committee carefully reviewed ISO/IEC 12207 and decided that, due to a number of shortfalls, it was necessary to create a new standard specifically for medical device software development. The AAMI used ISO/IEC 12207 as the foundation for their new standard “AAMI SW68, Medical device software – Software life cycle processes” SW68 (2001). In 2006, a new standard AAMI/IEC 62304 (2006) was released that was based on the AAMI SW68 standard.
* In 2006, ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62304:2006 (Medical Device Software – Software Life Cycle Processes) was released. Traceability plays a key role in this standard and is defined as the “Degree to which a relationship can be established between two or more products of the development process” (ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62304, 2006). 
* "ISO 14971:2007 (Medical devices – Application of risk management to medical devices) is the de-facto standard on risk management for medical devices"
